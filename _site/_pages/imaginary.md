## IMAGINARY

[IMAGINARY](imaginary.org) is an open source platform for mathematics communication resources. It is a non-profit organisation that started as the mathematics outreach project of the Mathematische Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO). I still work as a freelance project manager for them. Please get in contact by [email](mailto:antonia.mey@imaginary.org) if you are interested in any kind of mathematics related outreach activities, such as organising an exhibition or school visit etc. 

I currently manage their 'Snapshots of modern mathematics', which aims to make modern mathematical research more accessible. Take a look at this Snapshot on xxx for example, or just browse the content on the [imaginary website.](https://imaginary.org/snapshots)
 
My interest in outreach was sparked with an exhibit competition, for which a team consinsting of myself, Guiallaume Juvet and Chantalle Landry submitted a film on the mathematics behind glacial movement. Take a look here (it was awarded the 3rd price):

We made a follow up for the youtube fast forward science competition, winning the 1st prize for our category on solving an old glacial mystery.

As part of my work for IMAGINARY, I have coordinated exhibitions in various countries, such as Romania or Israel and coordinated teacher training sessions for the UNESCO.
