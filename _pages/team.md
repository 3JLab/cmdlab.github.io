### Undergraduate student projects
The group is happy to accommodate students from various disciplines, not just Chemistry. Ideally suited candidates are students in Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Biochemistry or Biotechnology, provided you have keen interest in exploring the interplay between Biology, Chemistry, and computational modelling and machine learning.  

### Summer student projects
Please send me an [email](mailto:antonia.mey@ed.ac.uk) if you are interested in doing a summer research project to discuss possible available options. 

Deadlines for summer projects are usually quite early in the year (end of January). Here is a none exhaustive list of funding sources:

* [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Funding/undergraduate-bursary.asp)
* [Carnegie Trust](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/vacation-scholarships/)
* [Edinburgh University Vacation](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCE/AcademicAffairs/SitePages/College-Vacation-Scholarships.aspx)
