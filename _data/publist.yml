- title: "Mechanism of the Pseudoirreversible Binding of Amantadine to the M2 Proton Channel"
  image: JACS.png
  description: We nvestigated the binding of amantadine (Amt) to the wild type (wt) M2 channel and its V27A variant using multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations, exploratory conventional metadynamics, and multiple-walkers well-tempered metadynamics calculations. The results allow us to propose a sequential mechanism for the (un)binding of Amt to the wt M2 channel, which involves the adoption of a transiently populated intermediate (up state) leading to the thermodynamically favored down binding mode in the channel pore. Furthermore, they suggest that chloride anions play a relevant role in stabilizing the down binding mode of Amt to the wt channel, giving rise to a kinetic trapping that explains the experimentally observed pseudoirreversible inhibition of the wt channel by Amt. We propose that this trapping mechanism underlies the inhibitory activity of potent M2 channel blockers, as supported by the experimental confirmation of the irreversible binding of a pyrrolidine analogue from electrophysiological current assays.
